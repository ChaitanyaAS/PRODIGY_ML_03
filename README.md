## **Cats vs. Dogs Image Classification with CNN**

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled images to distinguish between the two classes, using deep learning techniques to automatically extract relevant features from the images.

### **Key Steps in the Project**:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting it into training, validation, and test sets.
2. **Model Architecture**: A CNN is built with several convolutional layers, activation functions (ReLU), and pooling layers to capture spatial hierarchies in the images. The final output layer uses a softmax activation function for binary classification.
3. **Model Training**: The model is trained using backpropagation and optimized using the **Adam optimizer**. The model is evaluated using **accuracy** and **loss** metrics to assess its performance on the test data.
4. **Results**: The trained model achieves a high classification accuracy, effectively distinguishing between images of cats and dogs.

This project demonstrates the power of CNNs for image classification tasks and can be extended to more complex datasets or multiclass classification problems.
